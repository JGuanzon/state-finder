In the [statefindercode.ipynbk](https://github.com/JGuanzon/state-finder/blob/main/statefindercode.ipynb), we use machine learning to optimise the parameters of an optical circuit towards generating high quality quantum resource states (in particular, we employ the global optimisation algorithm *basinhopping*). These resource states are needed to perform entanglement purification in a linear-optical system, as discussed in our paper "Achieving the ultimate end-to-end rate of a lossy quantum communication network" [1]. Already optimised parameter sets are found in the statefinderdata folder.

We acknowledge the papers "Production of photonic universal quantum gates enhanced by machine learning" [[2](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.012326)] and "Progress towards practical qubit computation using approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes" [[3](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.101.032315)], whose code we have used and modified here for our own purposes. We also acknowledge the libraries *strawberryfields* [[4](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2019-03-11-129)] and *thewarlus* [[5](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01705)], which we used to perform the quantum simulation.
